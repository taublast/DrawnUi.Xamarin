# DrawnUI For Xamarin Forms
A Light version of [DrawnUI for .Net MAUI](https://github.com/taublast/DrawnUi.Maui) ported to Xamarin.Forms. 

### _iOS version not tested yet (need few days)_

Supports gestures and many virtual controls, main limitation of the Light version is lack of SkiaShell and some similar controls.

Will not support Xamarin Xaml HotReload, contrary to MAUI, due to Xamarin architecture.

_Uses a modified [Glidex.Forms](https://github.com/jonathanpeppers/glidex) project created by Jonathan Peppers for caching images on Android._
