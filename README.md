# DrawnUI For Xamarin Forms
A Light version of [DrawnUI for .Net MAUI](https://github.com/taublast/DrawnUi.Maui) ported to Xamarin.Forms. 

Supports gestures and many virtual controls, main limitation of the Light version is lack of SkiaShell and some similar controls.

_Uses a modified [Glidex.Forms](https://github.com/jonathanpeppers/glidex) project created by Jonathan Peppers for caching images on Android._
